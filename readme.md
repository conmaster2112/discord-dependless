# Discord-Dependless

A lightweight Discord API wrapper designed for simplicity and zero active dependencies. Unlike traditional libraries, **discord-dependless** allows sending messages persistent connection and gateway events are optional.

https://github.com/conmaster2112/discord-dependless

## Features

- **Zero Dependencies** â€“ Fully functional without external dependencies.
- **REST API Integration** â€“ Utility API functions without logging in.
- **Strongly Typed Core APIs** â€“ Inner APIs are build on strong typing system.
- **Result with Error Pattern** â€“ Inspired by Rust's `Result` handling to avoid unexpected crashes/throws.
- **Event Handling** â€“ Supports all Discord events (though not strictly typed yet).
- **Without WebAPIs Potential** â€“ Can be used with custom fetch methods by overwriting static apis functions

## Installation

```bash
npm install discord-dependless@v10
```

## Versioning

This package follows Discord's REST API versioning. The version tag reflects the API version being utilized:

- `@v10` uses Discord REST API v10. (Current Active Development)
- Future versions will continue to align with Discord's latest REST API updates.


## Usage

Basic example of sending a message with an embed:

```ts
import { Bot, Result } from "discord-dependless";

const bot = new Bot({ token: "<your-token-here>" });

await Result.unwrap(bot.sendMessage("channelId", {
    embeds: [
        {
            title: "Embed Title",
            description: "Super Duper Description",
            color: 0x000000
        }
    ]
}));
```

Expects all snowflake types as number strings, following Discord's Rest API

 - `Result.unwrap` unwrap used in this example to directly throws error if bot failed to send message.


## Why Use This?

- No need for persistent connections.
- Easier debugging compared to traditional Discord.js.
- Ideal for lightweight applications that only require few features

## Notes

- Events are available but not strictly typed yet.
- The package's structure is inspired by Rust's `Result` type to improve error handling.
- Use `Result.unwrap()` if you like throwing stuff :)

## Roadmap

- Further optimization and testing without hardcoded Web APIs.
- Improve event typing.
- Additional utility functions to enhance Discord interactions
